  		  <span>We’re so proud to be able to bring you SpeakEasy, a descendant of a long line of computers you can talk to. SpeakEasy has been trained after hours and hours of repetition to interpret what’s been said to it and respond appropriately. As anyone who’s ever responded with an enthusiastic “you too” to the cashier at the movie theater that told you to “Enjoy your film!” knows, speech is complicated. So how does SpeakEasy know what to say?<br>
        <br>
        Before we talked about training. You may not really think it, but you’ve been training to speak well all your life. Every chat in the car on the way to school, every late night conversation with a significant other, every time someone asks you “How’s it going?” is a learning experience. And after all those years and years of listening and speaking, without even noticing it you’ve built up a ton of relationships between words. Those relationships you’ve subconsciously built are why “How are you?” is as normal as a blue sky, and “How you are?” feels off, but is still understandable. The important thing to realize is that while speech may be complicated, it’s also consistent. It’s structured and stays relatively constant. “How are you?” feels right because you’ve heard it hundreds or possibly thousands of times. Whereas “hippopotamus coat hangar physically castle outstanding” feels very, very wrong. We’re pretty sure you’ve never experienced those words in that order before (we know because neither has Google).<br>
        <br>
        So, one major thing governing speech patterns is training. Another is context. When someone says, “My mother will be late” you don’t even have to think about asking “When will she be here?” as opposed to “he” because you’re automatically incorporating the context of ‘mothers are women.’ If we asked you, “What’s the weather like?” and you answered “My dog has been really energetic lately” it would be odd. Why? You’re completely ignoring the context of the question! We’re expecting something about rain or temperature or the sun. Instead, you talk about your dog, so your response seems completely out of the blue and feels off.<br>
        <br>
        SpeakEasy learns a lot like you do: it ‘listens’ when it gets fed data. We took all kinds of text-based conversations from sources such as movies, T.V. shows, interviews and more and designated calls and responses. Long monologues, or running text such as a book wouldn’t have worked. Speech is about the back and forth, and we had to do our best to mimic that with our data. We took all that text and we had SpeakEasy run through it over and over again. You can think of this almost like you when you were younger, sitting and listening to your parents talk to each other. Each time SpeakEasy sees a series of words together, it designates those relationships as more and more important.<br>
        <br>
        It sees “How” then “are” then “you” over and over again, so those words start to get linked together. It never sees “hippopotamus coat hangar physically castle outstanding”, just like we haven’t before, so it doesn’t incorporate those connections into its understanding. This is only half the problem, though. SpeakEasy also has to respond. Since “How are you?” has been designated as a call, it has to think about what kind of responses it’s most commonly seen. It essentially reverse engineers what it learned building relationships and turns that into a response. It's seen "Fine thanks!" many times, and considers that more highly than other potential answers.<br>
        <br>
        That isn't to say it will respond with "Fine thanks!" every single time it is asked "How are you?" Remember how we talked about context? SpeakEasy cares about context, just like people do. It is able to designate certain words as important and remember them. Then it uses those words it has purposefully remembered to inform its choices when it comes time to offer a response.<br>
        <br>
        How can you contribute? Talk to it! Remember, SpeakEasy learns by being trained, and it trains on data that resembles conversations. Head over to the **CHAT LINK** page and talk to SpeakEasy. It'll keep track of what's being said and incorporate it into its experience.<br>
        <br>
        Want to do more? Well, training SpeakEasy takes a LOT of computing power. So we've put together a neat little Chrome Extension that'll let us borrow a bit of your computer's processing to help SpeakEasy learn that much more quickly. You can download that **DOWNLOAD LINK** here. Don't worry, it's super easy to turn off any time you want.<br>
        <br>
        All of this is really exciting for us, we hope it is for you too. Please have a look around the site. Check out the **METRICS LINK** metrics page we put together with all kinds of sweet charts and graphs and other info.<br>
        <br>
        Thanks,
        <br>
