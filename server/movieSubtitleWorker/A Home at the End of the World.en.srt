Your mission is to pass as a 9-year-old
till further notice.

59
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,800
But l'm missing everything.

60
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,300
There's always more, pal.

61
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,100
-A flying saucer.
-What?

62
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,900
There's a flying saucer.
lt's above the back yard!

So where is it?

65
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,500
-You mean that airplane?
-l know what an airplane looks like.

66
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,800
You're an idiot, Frank.

67
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,600
Hey, aliens!

68
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,300

-Somebody call an ambulance!
-You're gonna be all right, okay?

75
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,400
My baby! Oh, my God, my baby!

You're gonna be all right. lt's okay.

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,700
lt's okay. lt's okay.

78
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,600
-Hey, man.
-Hi.

79
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,500

80
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,700

Thanks.

83
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,100
Hey, man.

84
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,900
Oh, hi.

85
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,300
Wanna smoke a joint?

86
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,400
Well, l guess so.

87
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,000
Yes.

88
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,700
Let's go.

89
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,400
l don't think this is working.

90
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,500
Be patient, man.

91
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,800
This is definitely not working.
l feel just like l always do.

92
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,600
So, Bobby, you new in town?

93
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,700
No, sir. l've been here all my life.

94
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000

95
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,000
...invisible.

96
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,500
-Well, welcome to the material world.
-Well, thank you, sir.

97
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,800
You made this bread?

98
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,400
Bread's a hobby of mine.
l can just about do it in my sleep.

99
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,100
So, what's your father do?

100
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,600
-He's a teacher, over at Fillmore.
-Your mother, does she work?

101
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,300
No. l mean...

102
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,200
...she died last year.

103
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,900
Oh, l'm so sorry.

104
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,000
You shouldn't be sorry.
You didn't even know her.

105
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,900
Well, l--

106
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,800

l'm sorry for your loss.

109

This is really good bread.

110
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,500
l really like your jacket.

111
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,200
lt's my brother's.

112
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,000
lt's cool.

113
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,000
He died too.

114
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,200
You wanna borrow it?

115
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,900
Here, go on.

116
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,200
lt fits you, man.

117
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,300
Wait a minute.

118
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,300
Here.

119
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,700
Take this.

120
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,200
Fits.

121
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,600
Hey, Dad.

122
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,400
-Boys?
-Shit!

123
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,700
Come on in, Mrs. Glover.

124
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,800
Sorry to intrude. l was just wondering,
what's that music?

125
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
lt's Laura Nyro.

126
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,100
Well...

127
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,000
...nobody wants a mother hanging around.

128
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,200
Bye, Mom.

129
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,500
Put that out. Please. You boys
are gonna get into trouble.

130
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,500
Mrs. Glover.

131
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,700
You've been so nice to me.

132
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,800
l was wondering....

133
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,200
You want a hit?

134
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,500
l do not.

135
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,100
There's nothing to fear. lt's all goodness.

136
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,600
l'm Jonathan's mother.

137
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,700
-Bobby, l don't really think--
-But...

138
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,400
...you're also...

139
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,100
...like....

140
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,400
Don't you dare tell your father.

141
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,400
What do l do?

142
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,400
Just pull the smoke
straight into your lungs.

143
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,500
That always happens.

144
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,000
Here, try again.

145
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,500
Good. That's good.

146
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,500
Now hold it.

147
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,600
What...?

148
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,200
What will it do, exactly?

149
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,300
l mean, what should l prepare myself for?

150
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,000
lt'll just make you laugh,
make you feel, you know, happy...

151
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,800
...and a little foolish.

152
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,200
Mrs. Glover?

153
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,500
This is so cool.

154
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,500
She sounds so sad.

155
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,900
She's the goddess.

156
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,700
l heard her singing, and l just--

157
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,100
l don't know.

158
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,500
She just sounds so beautiful...

159
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,200
...and lonely.

160
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,700
Mom?

161
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,400
Oh, thanks, dear.

162
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,800
We're all, you know,
beautiful and lonely here.

163
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,200
Come on, let's dance.

164
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,000
No.

165
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,700
-Absolutely not.
-Can't take no.

166
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,600
Look what you're making an old lady do.

167
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,300
-You're a good dancer.
-Well, l used to be...

168
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,700
...in the early Pleistocene.

169
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,000
Bobby, if you get cold,
there's a comforter in the hall closet.

170
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,900
-Thanks, Mrs. Glover.
-Okay.

171
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,200
-Good night, Mom.
-Good night.

172
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,900
The Stones are coming in March.

173
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
We've gotta get tickets.

174
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,100
We should go all three nights.

175
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,900
Dad?

176
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,900
Dad, it's getting late.

177
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,700
My angel.

178
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,400
-You poor baby.
-Thanks.

179
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,500
Sure thing.

180
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,400
So...

181
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,000
...that's it, man.

182
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,200
l'm like...

183
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,800
...the last of my kind now.

184
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,600
No, you're not.

185
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,900
l wish l'd been with him.

186
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,100
lt's all right.

187
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,500
Oh, mama, no. Life can't be this good.

188
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,500
Your father took me to see this
on our second or third date.

189
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,300
-Blessings on our Friday.
-What do you want to do?

190
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,300
-Something huge.
-There's nothing huge around here.

191
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:18,400
-You took your dad's car?
-Just a little spin, man.

192
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,000
Hey, can l hitch a ride?

193
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:02,000
Shit! Get out of here!
Get out of here right now!

194
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,900
-Shit. Shit.
-Jon. Jon.

195
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,100
-l gotta go.
-This is where you live.

196
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,200
This is all fucked up.

197
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,100
l guess we let things get--

198
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,200
-l mean--
-lt's love, man.

199
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,100
-lt's just love.
-We got carried away...

200
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,400
...and l think we should stop.

201
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,900
l mean, pretty soon we'll be out
of high school.

202
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,700
Then we'll be in college.

203
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,600
And l want to go to college in a big city.

204
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,100
-You're gonna go away?
-As soon as l can.

205
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,400
You're awake.

206
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,600
l just--

207
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,500
l wanted a drink of water.

208
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:38,200
l couldn't sleep either, so l decided
l might as well do something useful.

209
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,400
Maybe l shouldn't stay here anymore.

210
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,000
l'm not innocent in all this, Bobby.

211
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,100
l can't pretend to be.

212
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,700
l honestly don't know what to do.

213
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,700
l'm supposed to be the mother.

214
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,100
l'm the adult here...

215
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,800
...and l honestly don't...

216
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,800
...have the slightest idea what to do
or say to either one of you.

217
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,900
l should go...

218
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,000
...l guess.

219
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,000
Want to learn how to make a pie?

220
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,300
Sometimes it's good to just do
a simple, useful thing.

221
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,200
-l don't know.
-l haven't rolled out the second crust yet.

222
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:48,100
lt's not like bread dough. You mold that
until it comes to life.

223
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,200
Pie crust is just the opposite.

224
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:56,100
lt needs kid gloves. You handle it
as little as possible.

225
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:01,800
You'd be surprised how easy it is
once you learn a few of the tricks.

226
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,200
Just coax it.

227
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,900
That's right.

228
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,300
That's good.

229
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,200
That's very good.

230
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,500
At least Alice and l will never have to suffer
through another Cleveland winter.

231
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,700
You'll do better in Arizona, Ned.

232
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,900
Yep. New beginnings.

233
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,900
Just wish it wasn't so far.

234
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:02,800
No, man, Jonathan can just hop in a plane
from New York any time, and l'll be there.

235
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,700
Bobby...

236
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,200
...son...

237
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,200
...you can't move...

238
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,000
...to Arizona with Alice and me.

239
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,500
Son, you're 24.

240
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,500
-You can't just live with us forever.
-l know. l mean--

241
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,800
Time to get out in the world a little.

242
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,100
<i>No one's home. Leave a message.</i>

243
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,900
Hey, Jonnie.

244
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,000
Sorry, man, l'm not used to these things.

245
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,500
l'm calling to tell you--
Well, to ask you, really....

246
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,300
You see, Ned and Alice
are moving to Arizona...

247
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,900
...and l'm just here.

248
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,400
To tell you the truth, man,
l'm not sure what to do.

249
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,500
lt seems like l've just been...

250
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,400
...baking...

251
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,400
...for so long.

252
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,800
<i>Bobby?</i>

253
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,800
-You're here.
-l can't believe it, man.

254
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,100
You're here.

255
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,300
-How was your trip?
-lt was a trip.

256
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:34,400
Your new home.
Welcome to the Tarantula Arms.

257
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,400
l know, it's a lot.

258
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,100
Hey, man, you got bootleg Dylan.

259
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,300
-ls he here?
-He's here.

260
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,900
Welcome, Bobby.

261
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,500
Bobby, Clare, about whom
you've heard so much.

262
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,900
-Hi.
-l am so glad to finally meet you.

263
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,600
Me too. You.

264
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,700
Thanks for letting me, you know,
crash here for a while.

265
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:23,000
Well, come on. Grab your things,
get settled in. Come, Jonathan.

266
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,300
l like a little respite from all the décor.

267
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,200
You wanna go out to dinner,
or do you want to unpack first?

268
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,900
l mostly brought, you know...

269
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,600
...records.

270
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,400
-Let's go out.
-Okay.

271
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,200
-Have fun, boys.
-You come too.

272
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,700
Well, l--

273
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,800
No. You guys need
a little time alone, l think.

274
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,800
No, really. Come.

275
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,300
Okay.

276
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,700
l'll just put on my other eye,
and we're out of here.

277
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,100
-Bobby is adorable!
-He is, isn't he, in his Bobby way.

278
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,800
-Why are all the good ones gay?
-Bobby's not gay.

279
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,700
Well, it's hard to say exactly
what Bobby is. You want another beer?

280
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,400
Yeah.

281
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,500
Come on!

282
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,300
Tomorrow, l'm taking you up
to Central Park.

283
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,400
lnside a week, you'll have
the whole city figured out.

284
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,800
Hey, man.

285
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,200
-What?
-You got a tattoo.

286
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,900
Yeah, years ago, at NYU. l thought l could
be the kind of person who'd have a tattoo.

287
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,600
Cool.

288
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,700
Bobby.

289
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:14,000
l feel like there are things
we should talk about...

290
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,900
-...but l'm not sure what to say.
-What things?

291
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,500
You know, when we were kids...

292
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,800
...what we used to do.

293
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,000
Man, we were kids.

294
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,700
-So are you seeing anyone in Cleveland?
-No. l'm....

295
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:44,900
l was just, you know, working,
hanging out.

296
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,700
How about you?

297
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,800
-You seeing anybody?
-No.

298
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,300
No one in particular.

299
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,300
Hey, man.

300
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,800
Look what someone was throwing out.

301
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,200
Hey, Leonard C.

302
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,300
Right out there on the street,
along with dead spider plants and macramé.

303
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,700
How many times
did we get stoned to this?

304
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,800
l lost count.

305
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,500
Hey, man, l'm making lasagna.

306
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:30,600
We could knock off a bottle of Chianti
and listen to ''Suzanne,'' like, 1 0 times.

307
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,900
-Sorry, l've got a date.
-No problemo.

308
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,000
Save some for me.

309
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,900
You have to promise to make this,
at most, once a year.

310
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,700
Bobby, if l weigh 300 pounds,
l won't be able to get up the stairs.

311
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,400
Too bad Jonathan has to miss it.

312
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:52,000
Well, Jonathan has other priorities.

313
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,000
And it was the best.
We were out of our minds.

314
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,000
-You had a good time?
-The best. The best.

315
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,400
You know how sometimes
it seems like the DJ knows you?

316
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,600
That's what l'm talking about.

317
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,700
This is one of my sadness albums.

318
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,800
-After my divorce.
-You were married?

319
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,900
Years ago.
He was a sadistic drug addict...

320
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
...and l was, well, a masochistic,
aspiring drug addict.

321
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,900
-lt made sense, at the time.
-Where'd you meet him?

322
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:35,500
-Want a real laugh? Woodstock.
-You were at Woodstock?

323
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:40,300
-Like, the concert?
-Well, l don't tell just anybody, Bobby.

324
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,400
-What was it like?
-Muddy.

325
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,500
You never seen so much mud.
l felt like a pig.

326
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,900
l was attracted to Denny because he had
a bar of Lifebuoy soap down at the pond.

327
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:55,700
-Hey, have you ever heard Steve Reich?
-No.

328
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,100
lt's one of my favorites. Listen.

329
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,200
l just sort of catch whatever happens
to blow through.

330
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,400
Hey, beauties.

331
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,100
Hello, dear. You're home early.

332
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,900
Yeah, l was having a little less
than maximum fun.

333
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,600
Well, as you know, we always leave
the porch light on for you.

334
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,400
Love that.

335
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,200
-Jonnie, have you heard this guy?
-Steve Reich.

336
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,500
-Sure.
-He's great. He's amazing. He's just--

337
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,300
He's....

338
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,500
-Where'd you find him anyway?
-He found me.

339
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,000
He's a welcome addition
to the household.

340
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,500
Bobby, you'll have to find a job,
aren't you?

341
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,400
l'm a baker. Think a New York bakery
would hire me?

342
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,700
ln New York, someone will pay you
to do just about anything.

343
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,500
lf l make a living making hats--

344
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:22,400
She doesn't exactly make a living making
hats. She picks up a little change that way.

345
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,400
That is not true. l do have some money
left over from my grandfather...

346
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,100
...but l've stashed it
for when the baby comes.

347
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,800
-You're having a baby?
-Didn't Jonathan tell you?

348
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,600
-lt hasn't come up.
-l didn't know you two were--

349
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,300
Lovers? We're not.
Most parents aren't lovers. Mine weren't.

350
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:44,000
l know this must sound a little....

351
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,700
A little what?
A little free? A little great?

352
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:52,000
A little like insisting on our own happiness
even if it's not what people ordinarily do?

353
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,400
Well....

354
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,900
Babies.

355
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,300
l mean, hey, let's have a dozen.

356
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,400
-Shit, you scared me.
-Sorry, man.

357
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,700
What are you doing?

358
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,100
l get up and walk around
in the dark sometimes.

359
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,300
-Does that weird you out?
-No.

360
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,400
l don't know.

361
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,700
When the place is all dark...

362
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,200
...when you and Clare have gone to sleep,
and l'm awake...

363
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,100
...it's like being alive and being dead
at the same time, you know?

364
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,600
lt's this sort of halfway thing...

365
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,400
...where the people who are alive
are dreaming...

366
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,500
...and the people who are dead...

367
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,800
...are where they are.

368
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,300
And l'm here...

369
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,500
...in the dark and the quiet.

370
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,200
You want some water?

371
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,200
Sure.

372
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:40,300
-Are you and Clare really having a baby?
-Oh, God.

373
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
l don't know.

374
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,800
We've been talking about it.

375
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,500
lt's something she really wants.

376
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
l like Clare.

377
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,400
So do l.

378
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,100
-Bye, Lacey.
-See you.

379
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,400
We can take it from there
if we need to.

380
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,500
-And on the Thursday ad, we can--
-Oh, shit. l gotta go.

381
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,400
-Can you--?
-Yeah, l got it.

382
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,500
-Thank you.
-Bye, Jonathan.

383
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,800

-Hey, is your name Dirk?
-No, l'm Jonathan.

389
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,400
l'm sorry, l just-- You look like
someone l know named Dirk. l'm Wes.

390
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,700
Hey, Wes.

391
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:11,400
-These are my friends Clare and Bobby.
-Pleasure, Wes.

392
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,200
So, Jonathan, Bobby and l'll see you later.

393
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,400
-l thought we were all having dinner.
-All right, l'll see you later.

394
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,200
Do you know what l think?

395
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,400
Now, can Clare be absolutely honest
with you?

396
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,100
l think you need a new haircut.

397
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,000
Really?

398
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:38,300
You're so handsome, and that hippie do
does absolutely nothing for you.

399
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,100
l don't know.

400
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,400
-l never really, you know, think about it.
-Well, l do.

401
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,200
See, here's the thing...

402
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,900
...you don't look like yourself this way.
You know what l'm saying?

403
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,800
lf you look like someone
other than who you are...

404
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,100
...you could get the wrong job
and friends, who knows what.

405
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,700
-You may end up with someone's whole life.
-l think this is my life.

406
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,300
-lt doesn't seem like somebody else's.
-Check.

407
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,400
What do you think?

408
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,300
-l look so--
-Dangerous? Sexy?

409
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:35,100
-Stripped down, ready for action?
-That's not what l was thinking, exactly.

410
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:39,500
Well, you are definitely gonna start
turning heads around here now.

411
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,300
Bobby...

412
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,800
-...what do you like about me?
-What?

413
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,200
Do you...?

414
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,900
-Do you like me?
-l like you. Of course l like you.

415
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,500
l mean, could you...?

416
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,700
You know, do you have...?

417
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,600
God, l can't believe
you're gonna make me say it.

418
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,100
Do you think l'm attractive?

419
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,200
l....

420
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:18,200
That's what l thought
you were gonna ask.

421
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:22,800
And, yes, l-- Absolutely, l do.

422
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,000
Good.

423
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,400
That's good.

424
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:41,100
Well, there's just no smooth
or sophisticated way to do this, is there?

425
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,900
Clare.

426
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,700
No, listen.

427
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,900
You talk too much, darling.

428
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,600
lf you don't shut up,
l will come to my senses...

429
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,800
...and realize how stupid
and self-destructive this is.

430
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
l have to tell you, l've never...

431
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,800
...you know...

432
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,900
...done this before.

433
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,600
-Pardon me?
-l've never...

434
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,900
...you know....

435
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,700
-Never?
-No.

436
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,600
Does that freak you out?

437
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,000
No.

438
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:26,500
l mean, yes, of course it freaks me out!
Jesus Christ.

439
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,800
l guess maybe we should stop.

440
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,900
Maybe.

441
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,800
Because, you know...

442
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,900
...l may not be the most, like...

443
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,800
...adept.

444
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,900
Oh, honey.

445
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:52,000
You think l'm upset
because you might not be adept?

446
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,300
-ls that what you think?
-No.

447
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,000
l guess.

448
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,800
Okay, junior...

449
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,900
...mama's gonna teach you
a thing or two.

450
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,400
Are you nervous?

451
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,100
Don't be.

452
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,300
This is the most natural thing
in the world.

453
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,200
All right.

454
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,300
lt's all right.

455
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,200
Sorry l missed dinner.

456
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,500
Where is everybody?

457
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,600
Jonnie...

458
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,700
...are you okay?

459
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,800
Are you okay?

460
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,700
l guess.

461
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:28,500
-You should go back to Clare.
-No, man...

462
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,300
...l don't wanna leave you alone.

463
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:43,000
You should go back to Clare.

464
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,200
Really.

465
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,700
Bobby?

466
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,000
Lovey, wakey, wakey!

467
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:22,000
l am not here. You never saw me.
l'm just the cleaning lady. So sorry.

468
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,800
You were in bed.
We tucked you in at 2 a.m.

469
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,300
l went out again.

470
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,200
-Fun?
-Sort of.

471
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,100
Potential?

472
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,700
l don't think so.

473
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,300
So, what do we do now--?

474
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,200
-See you later, babies.
-Jonnie--

475
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,600
Oh, it's entirely fine. There's a whole world
full of art boys just outside.

476
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,700
No worries. Love you.

477
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,400
Hey, man.
What are you doing up here?

478
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,700
Some queen next door's got Mozart cranked.
l couldn't tear myself away.

479
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,100
Opera, huh?

480
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,800
Clare loves you.

481
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,400
l love Clare.

482
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,400
Doesn't this all seem sort of strange?

483
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,700
No, man, it's perfect.

484
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,900
Just like this.

485
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,300
Bobby, l'm starting to feel a little extra.

486
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,900
You're essential, man.

487
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,700
Let's dance.

488
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:20,600
-You can't dance to opera.
-You can dance to anything.

489
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,700
What are you doing?

490
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,300
A little kiss between brothers.

491
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,700
Nothing wrong with that.

492
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,700
Jon?

493
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,900
Jonnie?

494
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,900
Clare! Clare, wake up!

495
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,800
What?

496
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,100
Jonathan...

497
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:11,200
...you asshole! God.

498
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,400
We gotta find him.

499
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:17,600
Honey, he isn't lost. He left.

500
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,900
lt's my fault.

501
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,800
This is not true.

502
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,500
No, you don't understand.

503
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,800
Bobby...

504
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,300
...this is a problem of Jonathan's.

505
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,600
-Trust me.
-There's something fucked up about me.

506
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:40,000
There is nothing fucked up about you.

507
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,700
You don't know.

508
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,300
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Hi, Alice?

509
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,000
<i>Bobby, is</i> t<i>ha</i>t <i>you, honey?</i>

510
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,200
l don't wanna worry you,
but have you heard from Jonathan?

511
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,000
Of course. He's here.
Do you wanna talk to him?

512
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,000
<i>He's</i> t<i>here? Grea</i>t<i>, pu</i>t <i>him on.</i>

513
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:04,300
Bobby, l'm sorry,
it looks like he's gone to bed already.

514
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,300
-But l'll tell him you called, okay?
-<i>Tell him Clare and I are fine.</i>

515
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,200
Okay, sweetheart, l will.

516
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,600
Bye-bye.

517
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,700
Do you like it here?

518
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,800
Here l can, more or less,
breathe the air...

519
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,300
...and your mother's learned
how to make blue margaritas.

520
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:48,100
Whoever expected to end up living
in the desert?

521
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:53,300
Yeah, whoever expects
to end up living anywhere?

522
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,900
That's too deep for me.

523
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,000
How's that?

524
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,500
Looks a little bit like me, doesn't it?

525
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:24,200
We're not speaking to anybody
right now.

526
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:28,200
<i>Happy holidays.</i>
<i>Celebra</i>t<i>e, all you people.</i>

527
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,600
<i>Hello, Bobby,</i> t<i>his is Alice.</i>

528
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,300
<i>Swee</i>t<i>hear</i>t<i>,</i> t<i>here's some</i>t<i>hing</i>
<i>I have</i> t<i>o</i> t<i>ell you.</i>

529
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,300
Oh, look at you.

530
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,700
And this is Clare.

531
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:53,000
Oh, Clare. lt's so wonderful
to finally meet you.

532
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,600
-Thanks for coming.
-Thank you for having me.

533
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,200
Alice, sorry.

534
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,700
Alice?

535
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,200
-So clumsy.
-l'll get it.

536
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,600
lt's all right,
they cost a $ 1 .98 at Kmart.

537
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,600
Alice.

538
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,800
Do something for me.

539
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,200
-Anything.
-Hold me.

540
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,400
Just hold me.

541
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,200
Okay.

542
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,500
Tighter.

543
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:50,200
Don't be gentle with me.

544
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,300
Squeeze me harder.

545
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,800
Harder.

546
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:58,500
Make me feel like
you're breaking my ribs.

547
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:01,100
-Oh, God.
-l can't.

548
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,400
l don't wanna hurt you.

549
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,700
l love you.

550
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,900
-You're an angel.
-Mom?

551
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,900
l'll be right there, honey.

552
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,900
Anybody want a drink?

553
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,800
-Okay, sure.
-Okay.

554
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,300
l'm sorry about--

555
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,400
Well, all this.

556
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,300
l knew l'd see you both again.
l just imagined...

557
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,100
...well...

558
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,900
...different circumstances.

559
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:07,700
lt's okay.

560
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,600
lt's okay.

561
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,000
Ned, man...

562
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,100
...he was a trip.

563
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:22,100
He was like my father too.
You would have loved him, Clare.

564
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:25,200
-l'm sure.
-Bobby?

565
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:29,600
lf you want my family so badly,
l hereby bequeath them to you.

566
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:35,900
No. No, better yet, l hereby
bequeath you my whole entire life.

567
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:39,100
Be me. l hereby dub you
Jonathan Glover.

568
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:42,100
Tomorrow, when they cremate
my father's body...

569
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,900
...you can be the son,
and l'll be the best friend.

570
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:48,200
You can come back from the service
and console my mother.

571
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,800
Jonathan, stop it.

572
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:54,000
You're better at it than l am.
You're better qualified. So go at it...

573
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,700
-...be their son with my blessings.
-Listen to me, you little shit.

574
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:01,600
All he's ever done is worship you.
All you've done is walk out on him.

575
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,700
Don't you dare speak to him like that.

576
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:08,500
You don't know what you're talking about.
You don't know the first thing about worship.

577
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,200
Do you know?

578
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,300
Do you have any idea how much l--?

579
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:14,700
Listen, you guys--

580
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:20,900
How much l wanted you?
How much l loved you, you asshole?

581
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:26,100
You know, and then, what an idiot l am.
How pathetic is that?

582
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:28,700
Me, in love with you.
Then Bobby comes along...

583
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:32,000
...and l fall in love with this one,
then l think that we--

584
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:34,800
That the three of us,
maybe we could--

585
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,500
Fuck it.

586
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,500
Just leave me alone and go back
to the house and have a drink.

587
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:40,900
Clare!

588
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,800
How could you just leave
without saying anything?!

589
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,900
l couldn't be the uncle anymore.
Give me a break, okay?

590
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,900
-Clare, hey.
-Don't call me that.

591
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,200
What, don't call you what? Your name?

592
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,100
What did you think l would do
without you, Jonathan?

593
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:06,500
-What were you thinking?
-Clare, come on.

594
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,100
l'm pregnant, you fuckers!

595
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,300
What?

596
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:17,300
Are you sure?

597
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,800
l'm completely sure.

598
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
You wanted this, didn't you?

599
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,500
God help me.

600
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,700
Clare.

601
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:31,200
-Oh, man.
-You think?

602
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,700
Yes.

603
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,000
Yes.

604
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,500
What do you think about ''Ethan'' for a boy,
or ''Trevor''?

605
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,800
-Let's not get fancy.
-lf it's a girl, call her ''Clare Jr.''

606
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:15,700
One Clare per family is enough.

607
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:19,600
-What will the kid call Bobby and me?
-l never thought of that. ''Daddy.''

608
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,500
Like ''Daddy One'' and ''Daddy Two''?

609
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,700
-We're gonna have to move, aren't we?
-Right.

610
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,900
Funny family will need a third bedroom.

611
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:55,800
Funny family may need
a whole new neighborhood.

612
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,700
Somewhere where two out of three people
passing by are not psychotic?

613
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:02,100
-Exactly.
-How about Cleveland?

614
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,800
-No!
-Let's move here.

615
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,100
-Please repeat what you just said.
-lt's too hard to raise a kid in the city.

616
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:10,000
Don't you think?

617
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:15,500
What if the kid turned out to be
some sort of, l don't know, Heidi.

618
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:17,200
How much goodness do we want?

619
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,400
Growing up in the country
doesn't doom anyone to good behavior.

620
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:23,600
Most of the interesting murderers
come from derelict farms.

621
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,700
This is so adult, looking at real estate.

622
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:30,300
-We are adults, sort of.
-Who would the kid play with out here?

623
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,300
Woodland creatures,
like Snow White.

624
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:36,200
l don't want him hanging with squirrels.
They have personality disorders.

625
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,300
Stop it!

626
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:41,600
This one has a great soul,
don't you think?

627
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,400
Baby?

628
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:46,200
-lt's your money.
-lt's my grandfather's money.

629
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:49,200
-l didn't earn a dime of it.
-Still.

630
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,200
You'd be the owner.

631
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,800
What do you think?

632
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:59,300
You really want this, don't you?

633
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:02,200
lf you do.

634
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,200
lf we all do.

635
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:11,700
No, you, Bobby Morrow.
Beautiful, crazy boy.

636
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:16,800
-You want this, and l could get it for you.
-No, it'd be for us.

637
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:32,500
So long, treasures.

638
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:17,200
l'm thinking white here.
Totally white, like a Shinto shrine...

639
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,800
...and we can hang
paper lanterns all over.

640
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:23,900
-You are the gayest human being ever.
-Somebody's gotta be gay around here.

641
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:25,500
What do you like?

642
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:30,000
l think l'm gonna go and fix a window.

643
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:33,100
Okay. Jonathan, blue is your friend.

644
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,800
See, blue is the color of sky and water.

645
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:40,600
-Yeah, but white goes with everything.
-Well, honey, it's a house, not an outfit.

646
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:28,500
-lt's all right, l'll do it.
-No, sleep. lt's my night.

647
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:34,600
lt's okay, Bobby's doing it.
lt's his night.

648
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:43,500
lf we don't keep to the schedule,
we'll all be exhausted by tomorrow.

649
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:47,800
-l don't care. l miss my daughter.
-Guess nobody's sleeping tonight.

650
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:51,300
Hello, Rebecca. Hello.

651
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:56,800
Oh, sweetie.

652
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:05,200
-Hey, beauties and heroes.
-Where have you been?

653
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,900
l got something to show you.

654
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:11,700
-This town's crying out for a cool café.
-This town's crying out for an outlet mall.

655
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,500
What? lt has possibilities.

656
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:25,900
Where? Point out a possibility.

657
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:29,100
Kitchen's basically okay,
just needs a good cleaning.

658
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:31,500
Look, wood floors.

659
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:34,200
-ls that a termite?
-No.

660
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,300
Yeah, maybe.

661
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,800
l think l got a name.

662
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:42,100
The Home Café.

663
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,200
What do you think?

664
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,300
Well, it would be better for business...

665
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:51,200
...than ''The Squalor and Desperation Café,''
l suppose.

666
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:55,700
And the goddess said, ''Feed the people
and send them out happy into the night.''

667
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:01,100
How's that mushroom lasagna
holding up?

668
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:04,100
-Two more orders left.
-Save them for Martha and Gill.

669
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:05,900
No problem.

670
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,400
-You got them, my dears.
-Thanks, Jonathan.

671
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:17,100
We're home, dear.
Oh, she's not happy today.

672
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:20,000
For a full hour. l have no idea.

673
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,600
Hey, honey.

674
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:27,500
-Just feeling shitty?
-l think she's getting sick.

675
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:30,600
l gotta get dressed
and get back to the restaurant.

676
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:34,700
Yeah. And l have to, well,
pick up some toys.

677
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,800
-You okay?
-Never better.

678
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:46,600
l seem to have ended up the mother
and the wife, haven't l?

679
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:50,400
-That's not fair.
-No, that's not fair.

680
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,900
And l can't help that.

681
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,400
l thought you'd be out here.

682
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:04,300
l'm sorry.

683
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,800
You haven't done anything.

684
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,700
l just want everybody to be happy.

685
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,900
-l know you do.
-lt won't always be like this. We're...

686
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,500
...still getting started.

687
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:24,600
Bobby, what if l...

688
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,800
...just couldn't do this?

689
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,500
lt'll be okay. Trust me.

690
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,200
You know, l think, maybe l'm not...

691
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:37,700
...this unusual.

692
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,600
l think maybe it's just my hair.

693
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:48,400
-l love your hair.
-Come here.

694
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:00,800
-Oh, Bobby!
-Oh, <i>mamaci</i>t<i>a</i>!

695
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,700
Here you are.

696
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:07,800
-Look what you've done!
-Our little place.

697
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,300
lt's beautiful!

698
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:15,400
Oh, that's Ned and me!
Where did you find this?

699
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:18,900
Oh, it's lovely, all of it.

700
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:22,800
-l wanna see the kitchen.
-Come on.

701
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,300
Oh, l love it!

702
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:44,300
So here it is.
Yasgur's Farm, the holy ground itself.

703
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:49,500
lt's hard to believe all that went on here,
isn't it? lt just looks like....

704
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:52,200
Mud puddle and a field of cowpies?
l know.

705
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,300
-Come on in, you people!
-No.

706
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:59,800
l have been in that water before.
Bobby, don't you dare put her in there!

707
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,700
Boys, give them a puddle to play in....

708
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,400
They're sweet together, aren't they?

709
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:14,200
-ln their gooney way.
-l think you're very brave.

710
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,300
-You do?
-Yeah.

711
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:23,400
When l was your age,
you got married and you had a family.

712
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,800
Never occurred to you
to do anything else.

713
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:29,700
Well, you know, l wanted that.
l wanted...

714
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,800
...just a more normal thing
when l was younger.

715
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,400
Just wanted a husband
and a baby and....

716
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,400
l think maybe you're better off.

717
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:41,500
Really.

718
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,100
One minute you have everything
you ever wanted, and the next...

719
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:49,600
...you find yourself in some
suburban neighborhood somewhere.

720
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:54,100
And it's fine. l mean,
it's not not fine, it's just....

721
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:58,100
The world just...

722
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,700
...starts to shrink around you somehow.

723
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:12,300
Most women have absolutely
no idea what they're getting into.

724
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,800
No.

725
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:18,300
l don't suppose anyone knows
what they're getting into...

726
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,000
...till they're into it.

727
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:36,900
-For God's sake.
-Hey, what's up?

728
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:39,200
A little privacy, please.

729
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,800
You never wanted privacy before.

730
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:45,200
You okay?

731
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,300
Yeah, l'm fine.

732
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,400
What's that?

733
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:54,000
lt's nothing.

734
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,200
Come here.

735
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:11,800
lt's one of those spots, l think.

736
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:28,200
No, man, it's a bruise.

737
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:30,700
Maybe.

738
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,600
Absolutely.

739
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,600
-Will you do something for me?
-Sure.

740
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,800
-Don't tell them.
-l won't.

741
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:40,400
l can't....

742
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,200
-lf l'm sick--
-You're not sick.

743
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:48,500
Just promise me that, then, okay?

744
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:51,400
-lf it's just a bruise--
-lt is a bruise.

745
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,600
lf l just bumped my hip,
there's no reason to mention it.

746
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,200
-lt is a bruise.
-Okay, there's no reason to talk about it.

747
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:00,100
-Okay.
-All right.

748
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:45,800
-Mom, is that...?
-Your father's ashes.

749
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,500
l thought there'd be a right moment.

750
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:52,300
Suddenly, if l don't give them
to you right now...

751
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:55,300
...l'll have to take them back
to Phoenix with me.

752
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:58,400
He wouldn't have wanted them
scattered in Arizona.

753
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:03,000
-l thought we could scatter them here.
-Here?

754
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:05,800
Well, this is your home, isn't it?

755
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:07,800
l guess.

756
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:13,600
You know, l think it might be best just
to be done with it. He was a modest man.

757
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:16,200
He wouldn't have wanted
an elaborate ceremony.

758
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,600
-Mom.
-And l can tell you this...

759
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,600
...this is no more him than a pair
of his old shoes.

760
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:27,100
Not yet. l'm--
Not here, not now. l'm not ready.

761
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:33,100
Well, whenever you are.

762
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,700
-We should go.
-Okay.

763
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:54,500
-Oh, l love you, honey.
-l love you too.

764
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,800
l'll see you at the café.

765
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,600
Bye!

766
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:17,200
l know. Did you get yourself dirty?
Did you? You got yourself so dirty.

767
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:18,700
l need powder.

768
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,300
Did you get yourself dirty?
l know you did.

769
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:27,900
-You're so sexy like this.
-You are a true pervert. Get me the powder.

770
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:34,700
What happened?
You got something on your face.

771
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:36,700
Here, let me.

772
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:58,800
You can do anything, can't you?

773
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,900
-Me? No.
-l mean it.

774
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:04,600
You can live in the suburbs,
in the East Village, in the country.

775
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,300
lt doesn't make any difference to you,
does it?

776
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:10,800
l don't know. l never really think about it.

777
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:14,700
There you go, all done. Come on.

778
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:17,300
Thanks.

779
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:21,100
Come here. Sit up there, princess.

780
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:32,300
You are a strange
and mysterious creature.

781
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:35,400
l'm, like, the least mysterious one
around here.

782
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:37,800
l bet you could live in the Sahara.

783
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,000
l bet you'd just pitch a tent
and find someone to sell you a camel.

784
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:46,000
l mean it. ls there anything
you couldn't do?

785
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:53,200
l couldn't be alone.

786
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,300
Nope.

787
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:01,900
No, you couldn't, could you?

788
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,200
Hey, man.

789
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,700
Blessings on our day off.

790
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:24,100
l wonder if we should be closing
on Mondays.

791
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:28,800
-l feel a little guilty about it.
-No worries, please.

792
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:35,400
Hey, that little bruise gone away?

793
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:39,800
Well, no.

794
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,000
Let me see.

795
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:48,300
-lt's the same.
-Let me see.

796
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,800
See? lt's the same.

797
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:02,100
No, man, it's fading.

798
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:08,800
-You really think so?
-Absolutely.

799
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:31,000
You wanna dance?

800
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:35,200
-What?
-Come on.

801
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:21,800
Jonathan.

802
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:36,000
Hi.

803
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:44,300
l was so in love with you.

804
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:49,200
l was in love with you too.

805
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:57,700
But Bobby is the love of your life.

806
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,400
You know it's not that simple.

807
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:07,800
lt's just that...

808
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,100
...l seem to have ended up....

809
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,500
-Come to bed.
-l can't sleep.

810
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,100
Do you want me to get up?

811
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:27,900
No.

812
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:30,400
Go back to sleep.

813
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:33,700
Good night, crazy mama.

814
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:40,100
lt'll all seem better in the morning.

815
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:55,700
-Gonna miss you.
-lt's just a few days.

816
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:02,000
-You're taking a lot of stuff.
-Well, she needs a lot of stuff.

817
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,800
Okay, l think we're all set.

818
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:16,600
So....

819
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:21,600
Bobby, do you wanna come with us?

820
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,800
l can't.

821
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:28,800
Bobby.

822
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:33,100
Do you wanna come with us?

823
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,100
No.

824
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:52,100
Okay.

825
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:55,400
Okay.

826
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:59,700
-Call me.
-l will.

827
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:02,000
-Okay?
-Yeah.

828
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:15,600
You're a brave woman,
visiting your mother all alone.

829
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:18,400
She's not alone.
She's got Rebecca with her.

830
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,100
Now...

831
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,800
...don't worry, Miss R.

832
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:29,300
The best thing about Philadelphia
is you can leave it...

833
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:33,000
...and we'll be waiting for you right here
when you come home.

834
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,100
lf you're lucky and good...

835
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:39,800
...we'll have a special surprise waiting
for you when you get back.

836
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:45,700
Lovey. Lovey.

837
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:54,400
Boys.

838
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,300
Be good.

839
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:01,800
Always.

840
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:04,400
Love you.

841
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,700
You sleeping, man?

842
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,000
l can't, really.

843
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:01,800
They're not coming back, you know.

844
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:43,900
-This is a good spot, don't you think?
-Yeah, l do.

845
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:48,400
You think we should, like,
say a few words?

846
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
We got this far, Dad.

847
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,400
l think you'd like it. l really do.

848
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,400
-Hey, man.
-l should've written something.

849
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,800
No, man. This is perfect.

850
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:09,600
Anyway, Dad, here we are.

851
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:12,600
lt's our place.

852
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,000
And it's yours too.

853
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:19,800
Okay.

854
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,100
Now.

855
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:31,500
One.

856
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:33,900
Two.

857
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,100
Three.

858
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:41,700
-<i>Wha</i>t<i>'s</i> t<i>ha</i>t<i>?</i>
-<i>Window pane.</i>

859
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:45,300
-For clarity of vision.
-lf something bad happens...

860
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:48,800
...tell my parents l tried to be good,
but it was just too hard.

861
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:53,200
You're not freaked out about
the graveyard? l mean, don't be.

862
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:55,400
The dead are just people too.

863
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,200
People who wanted the same things
we want.

864
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,100
What do we want?

865
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:05,100
l don't know, man.

866
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:08,600
l mean, our lives, right?

867
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:12,100
Man, like, this whole big,
beautiful, noisy world...

868
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:16,600
...and everything that can happen.

869
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,700
All's well, little brother.

870
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,800
Your folks love you.

871
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:27,600
l love you.

872
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:33,200
Nothing to fear.

873
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,400
l've been thinking,
we should repaint Rebecca's room.

874
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,400
-Like, pink.
-She'd like that.

875
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,700
-Don't you think?
-Okay.

876
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:11,100
She'll come back someday...

877
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:14,300
...to this house, l mean.

878
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,100
lt'll be hers.

879
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:22,300
l guess it will be.

880
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:24,700
She probably won't want it, right?

881
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:28,800
She probably won't have any idea
what to do with it.

882
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:32,000
But still, it'll be hers, you know?

883
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:34,900
lt'll be hers.

884
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:39,100
Listen.

885
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:46,100
This will be an all right place
to put my ashes too, okay?

886
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:51,700
Sure.

887
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:57,400
l mean, whatever you want.

888
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:01,500
You built us a very good home.

889
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:03,300
That's not what--

890
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:07,000
That's what you did.

891
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:12,400
That's what you did for me, you know?

892
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,700
lt's funny, isn't it?

893
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:21,700
What?

894
01:30:23,700 --> 01:30:26,300
The big, beautiful, noisy world.

895
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:29,500
Everything that can happen.

896
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:34,400
Yeah.

897
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:37,400
lt's funny.
