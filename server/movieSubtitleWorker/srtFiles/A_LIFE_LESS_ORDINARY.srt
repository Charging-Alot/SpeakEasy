the newspapers we're here.

663

They never leave us alone,

It's OK.

Right.

682

It was so romantic.

683
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,380
We stayed there
for our honeymoon...

684

but it wasn't long enough...

685
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:44,140
so we came here for the sake

Then let's go.

1792
01:31:56,820 --> 01:31:58,700
GLADYS KNIGHT:
But I'm too afraid to show it

1793
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:00,300
If I were your woman

1794
01:32:00,380 --> 01:32:01,580

Never, no, no, no

01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:15,860
Stop loving you

1802

Oh, yeah

1803
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:23,260
If I were your woman

1804
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:27,020
Do you know what I'd do?

1805
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:31,100
I'd never, never, never
stop loving you

1806
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:34,420
If I were your woman

1807
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:37,140
Your sweet loving woman

[Both gasping]

1819
01:33:08,860 --> 01:33:11,300
So, how was it?

1820
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:13,100
O'REILLY: Believe me, Gabriel.

1821
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:14,780
You don't want to know.

1822
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:17,580
- But it worked.
- Yeah.

1823
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:20,540
Love...

1824
01:33:20,580 --> 01:33:21,620
worked.

1825
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:25,820
Ameratus pathum laborium.

1826
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:27,780
Are we going home now?

1827
01:33:27,860 --> 01:33:29,940
We're going home.

1828
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:31,740
At last.

1829
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:32,900
Ohh!

1830
01:33:59,660 --> 01:34:02,900
OASIS SINGING: The paper boy
is looking before he goes

1831
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:06,100
Lying to the teacher
who knows he knows

1832
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:10,340
He didn't, and he should've
brought his lines in yesterday

1833
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:16,180
Ernie bangs the sound
as the day begins

1834
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:18,220
The letterbox is open,
and your cash falls in

1835
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:19,740
Aah!

1836
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:24,300
I'll meet you at the office
just before the staff clock in

1837
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:28,860
Round our way

1838
01:34:28,940 --> 01:34:30,820
The birds are singing

1839
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:34,940
Round our way

1840
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:38,220
The sun shines bright

1841
01:34:38,300 --> 01:34:40,140
Aah!

1842
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:42,180
Round our way

1843
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:44,780
The birds sing for you

1844
01:34:44,860 --> 01:34:48,740
'Cause they already know you

1845
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:52,020
Yeah, they already know you

1846
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:06,740
The game is kicking off
in around the park

1847
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:09,740
It's twenty-five a side,
and before it's dark

1848
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:11,260
There's gonna be a loser

1849
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:13,460
And you know the next goal wins

1850
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:17,460
Cab it to the front

1851
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:19,580
As it's called a draw

1852
01:35:19,660 --> 01:35:22,660
Everybody's knocking
at yours once more

1853
01:35:22,740 --> 01:35:24,660
Ernie bangs the sound

1854
01:35:24,740 --> 01:35:27,220
And no one's spoken
since half past four

1855
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:30,020
La la la la la la la

1856
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:34,420
Round our way
the birds are singing

1857
01:35:36,380 --> 01:35:41,780
Round our way
the sun shines bright

1858
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:48,500
Round our way
the birds sing for you

1859
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:51,860
'Cause they already know you

1860
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:56,660
Yeah, they already know you

1861
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:01,460
BECK SINGING: On the highway

1862
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:03,060
Unpaved

1863
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:04,740
Going my way

1864
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:07,020
You're so alone today

1865
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:08,940
Like a ghost town

1866
01:36:09,020 --> 01:36:12,020
I found there's no relief

1867
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:14,180
No soul to mercy

1868
01:36:14,260 --> 01:36:17,460
Is it true what they say?

1869
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:19,380
You can't behave

1870
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:22,300
You gamble your soul away

1871
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:24,700
Measuring your dreams

1872
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:26,500
Oh, this life seems

1873
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:30,020
Like the gristle of loneliness

1874
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:31,900
Do do do do

1875
01:36:31,980 --> 01:36:36,860
Don't let the sun
catch you crying

1876
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:38,700
Do do do do do

1877
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:45,100
Don't let the sun
catch you crying

1878
01:36:58,740 --> 01:37:00,500
Like an ice age

1879
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:03,540
Nice days on your way

1880
01:37:03,580 --> 01:37:06,220
Sipping the golden dregs

1881
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:07,860
On a riptide

1882
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:09,300
Freaks ride

1883
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:10,940
Sleep inside

1884
01:37:11,020 --> 01:37:13,820
A parasite's appetite

1885
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:16,580
Oh, say, can't you see

1886
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:18,260
The chemistry?

1887
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:21,260
The parasites, the cleanup fee

1888
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:23,700
Death metal hands

1889
01:37:23,780 --> 01:37:25,660
Recycled cans

1890
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:30,700
Get well cards
to the hostage vans

1891
01:37:30,780 --> 01:37:36,140
Don't let the sun
catch you crying

1892
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:37,700
Do do do do do

1893
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:43,980
Don't let the sun
catch you crying

1894
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:48,780
LUSCIOUS JACKSON SINGING:
I got a magical ray

1895
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:50,900
That reads you
like a book, yeah

1896
01:37:50,940 --> 01:37:55,540
You got a mystic pen
that sends me the message

1897
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:58,100
Tests of my strength

1898
01:37:58,180 --> 01:37:59,900
Are pretty much all I know

1899
01:37:59,980 --> 01:38:03,620
For the rest of my life,
I will be climbing somewhere

1900
01:38:03,700 --> 01:38:07,700
Climbing

1901
01:38:07,780 --> 01:38:10,980
Climbing

1902
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:13,540
Somewhere

1903
01:38:15,260 --> 01:38:18,820
Somewhere

1904
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:22,820
And I have no fear

1905
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:26,660
I have no fear

1906
01:38:26,740 --> 01:38:31,020
'Cause love is here

1907
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:35,300
Love is here

1908
01:38:35,380 --> 01:38:39,420
Love is here

1909
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:43,260
Love is here

1910
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:44,500
Love is...

1911
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:46,500
Did you know
that I'm looking at you now

1912
01:38:46,580 --> 01:38:48,740
With a daisy in my hair

1913
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:49,940
Roses in my hand

1914
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:52,620
And broken rhythms in disrepair

1915
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:54,740
I hear

1916
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:56,260
A danger in the air

1917
01:38:56,340 --> 01:39:00,260
For the rest of my life,
I will be climbing somewhere

1918
01:39:00,340 --> 01:39:03,820
Climbing

1919
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:07,700
Climbing

1920
01:39:07,780 --> 01:39:10,340
Somewhere
